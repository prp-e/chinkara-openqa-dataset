# Chinkara Open Question Answering Dataset

This is a dataset based on [Dolly 15k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/databricks/databricks-dolly-15k) dataset. We've only taken *open_qa* parts of those instructions and then created our new dataset. This dataset can be used in your projects using `datasets` library and it's also accessible on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MaralGPT/chinkara_open_qa).

## Goal

The goal of creating this dataset was to train our model [Chinkara](https://github.com/prp-e/chinkara) on it and test the outcome compared to the old Guanaco one.
